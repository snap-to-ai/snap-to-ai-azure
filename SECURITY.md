# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Security fixes are provided for the current Microsoft Store release of Snap to AI for Microsoft Azure. Older sidelines or developer-preview builds are not covered.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We support both public and private channels. Choose the option that matches the sensitivity of your report.

### GitHub Issue (default)
1. Open a new Issue using the "Report a security vulnerability" template.
2. Share a clear description, impact, and sanitized reproduction steps. **Do not include secrets, tenant identifiers, or customer data.**
3. Monitor the Issue for follow-up questions. We reply to new reports within 3 business days.

### Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)
If sensitive information (e.g., exploit code, customer data, or unpublished infrastructure details) is required, submit the report privately through the [MSRC portal](https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report) and include "Snap to AI for Microsoft Azure" in the product field. You may optionally reference the GitHub Issue number for easier coordination.

When contacting us via either channel, please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code (sanitized if public).
- Any temporary mitigations you have identified.

We coordinate disclosure timelines following MSRC guidance and recognize reporters at our discretion after a fix ships.
